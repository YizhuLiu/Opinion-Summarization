| I tried to order steak kebob but they made beef kebob. | I asked for tzaziki on the side but they covered all the meat with tzaziki. | Taste is more like middle eastern. | Not Mediterranean. | Thanks you and will definitely be back! | Woww! | Order of falafel. | Cucumber drink. | Side of garlic sauce. | Side of cucumber sauce. | Absolutely clean filling. | Will have you craving for more. | I can't believe I hadn't heard of this restaurant sooner. | Thought there would be more room inside for eating. | I usually get the wraps (chicken or beef are my go - tos). | And it. | If you like spicy - get the hot sauce. | Mix it with the white sauce, you won't be disappointed.
| Very unique. | One of my new favorites for sure. | there should be lines around the block to get in. | My fav item tonight was the salted carmel cheesecake. | The reason for the three star review is because they do not accept credit / debit cards...cash or check only. | Also, a little pricey for what you get. | The portions aren't too big. | Everything was flavored well. | Would def return. | No reason why you shouldn't be eating here.
| We call this " Red Chicken. | I like this place. | It could be a lot better, but with no competition around, they do nt have to be. | But at least its decently quality & tender meat. | It is a whole in the wall and just a gem. | I will totally cater with a tray of this stuff, but may end up hoarding it to myself. | My bro and I have found this place by chance. | For sure, I will recommend it! | Just remember CASH ONLY you can eat for as little as $5 but bring $10 and you can get anything you want. | Eat here, you will be happy.
| Reviews didn't do it justice. | We will be back. | We will definitely be back. | Would rather IHOP across the street.
| I would definitely recommend it! | Super yummy. | Totally go there! | I don't remember which one I ordered but it was a vegetarian burrito with avocado and egg as two main ingredients. | it was also fun to people watch all the law enforcement officers and legal professionals as they came in. | Will definitely come again. | I had bacon, eggs, toast and a hash brown. | Food=3, Place=3, and Service=5. | Definitely recommend. | I say more.
| Thank you Jessica! | Employees are nice and helpful. | I am not going back. | I was a little pushy for the quote because I was in a time crunch and had a very particular idea. | We spoke,   I emailed her my idea and budget and we worked out what I needed for a reasonable price. | I was beautiful but I was still nervous about the taste. | You guys gave me exactly what I was looking for. | I will definitely be back when I'm in town.
| Best restaurant I have ever eaten at. | I have been going to Rosemary's for years. | I have even been there for winemaker dinners. | It is reputation is on word of mouth. | I have been there many times and it's always good. | I have never a had a bad meal here. | And by eating there you support local business which is always a good thing. | Sad News .... | Looking forward to my second visit here since May of 2010 .... | I'm a fan. | I've been there perhaps 10 times? | Never had a bad dinner.
| Incredible! | Steve is meticulous, accurate and knows what he's doing. | I will definitely be calling him again! | Spent more time than necessary taking notes, then never gave me a quote--which he said he would e - mail me. | Steve and Justin were super accommodating! | Excellent all around. | Would recommend without reservation. | Left a voice mssg last week. | Did not receive a call back. | I know I had left my number twice. | Website does not work. | Would definitely use them again if anything comes up. | Had a problem with my disposal, and Red Truck Handyman came out right away on a Friday night. | Fixed the problem quickly. | Thanks Steve. | Steve is exceptional and have used his services for quite a long time. | You will be glad you called him first.
| There is one girl that works there that is way friendlier than the others ..... if everyone acted like her, this would have been an easy 5 stars. | I have to say that i often have trouble finishing my entire sandwich. | Sandwiches come with Lays (baked or full - fat). | I reccomend. | I think it was the chicken salad pesto sandwich amaaaazing! | I would definitely return when in Cleveland! | It blows away any chain restaurants such as Subway or Quizno's. | I must return soon...today perhaps ... | I tried their special sandwich of the day - veggie grilled cheese. | I ordered their veggie pizza sub. | I loved it. | I will be coming here often. | La Bodega is great!
| We were surprised to find Matt's Big Breakfast at the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. | We usually visit the downtown location when we travel to Phoenix, but ran out of time this trip. | I got here early enough to not have to brave the long line out front (although knowing what I know now I would have happily done it). | I highly recommend it. | Quick service all around. | Great ok every way.
| Went with my wife to go and check out the gun counter for their up and coming Black Friday sale and seen some firearms we wanted to buy that day that wasn't listed for the sale. | Due to their ignorance I won't be shopping there again. | There were so many outdoor and sport gear. | I don't really actually shop at Bass Pro. | And they have different shooting games, checkers, etc . | that you can play. | And if you do happen to be into fishing and/or hunting, you'll find what you need here. | Only paid $29. | Come here if you need anything for the outdoors!! | Especially if you don't take yourself seriously. | My Dad, friend and I had an under cover security guard watching us closely by the time we left (not very sneaky sir).
| I will give them another chance. | 5 stars for this managers response and handling of the situation. | If you know how to pack your bowl its ok. | The card reader automatically adds 15% tip so you gotta either figure it out or tip ... haha. | $ 30 seemed a bit much for 2 ppl. | Been coming here for years! | I love that you can build your own bowl. | They offer lunch and dinner prices. | Went into the resturant last night with my husband and daughter and baby. | Didn't know how the whole system worked ... | The lady that checked us in explained everything and was super friendly. | The kids were super excited to find out the meal came with ice cream at the end. | Right before we left the lady working at the front came and asked how everything was. | My boyfriend and I come here after we fight! | It's actual therapy ... we leave happy. | Others have described the process, and they're right. | It is very tasty, but I did struggle with making my sauce, I didn't think the ingredients available were labeled very well. | The employee helped me out and made the sauce I wanted though.
| 00 prescription program. | Whether or not you have insurance they will still give it you for $4 . | 00 as long as its in that list. | Oh hey, it's a Target. | Meh, it was and it wasn't. | It was basically the same as every other Target. | Nothing remarkable to report. | It's a Target. | It's got everything any Target would have. | It's perfectly fine. | This has to be one of my favorite Targets by far! | lol! | Highly recommended. | Only thing I don't like is being able to swipe my Target card and not needing to sign for purchases under $50. | com for me and handle everything with them for me! | I came in today for a few things and am always in a rush. | Additionally she recommended some facial masks. | She then checked me out and I was swiftly on my way. | So now I get to go home repurchase everything online only to return it when it arrives so I can receive the second item at 50% off. | LOVE this target (greatland).
| Saturday morning breakfast. | Don't think you can go wrong eating here. | Originally, we plan on going to Bouchon. | The manager told us that they were doing a yearly maintenance and had closed early.
| These are the must have: Pork Cheek, Pork Belly, Beef Tounge and Saba Shio. | It's definitely worth the drive. | I'd definitely repeat. | We will be going back! | We got their pork kimchi stir fry, unagi kabayaki, tori kara age, a couple rolls, and they have a maccha waffle. | I shouldn't be eating this, but I did, and I regret nothing! | It's a maccha waffle with vanilla ice cream and strawberry sorbet, served with syrup and butter. | Rumy and Bryan top notch servers for real. | Spicy tuna bowl. | Mouth water AF get it with the gyoza sauce telling you guys. | It's open late which is perfect for me but they don't let you do Togo orders in the evening which is a bummer. | Worst 60 . | 00 I've ever spent.
| Got me right in. | Definitely will be back. | BEST NAIL SALON EVER. | I am definitely coming back here again!!! | Professional . | quality work! | I will be back. | Why wouldn't she tell me that to begin with instead of asking me what I needed? | I didn't see anyone waiting. | They just didn't give me a chance or even asked if I would like to make an appointment. | Just blew me off.
| It took a while for her to take my order since she's working alone and busy making previous orders. | They should hire at least two people at any given time. | This drink is like that. | Initially, this drink gives a overwhelmingly almond fragrance. | I hated it, it was gross. | Went here 2 days ago and it was my first visit. | I will be coming back.
| The flavors and hospitality were absolutely amazing. | The woman behind the counter walked me through their process and got me to sample all the sauces. | I'll be back. | I tried the Brisket and Pulled Pork. | Finally got to go to this place. | From this point in, the will be my go to place for BBQ, no doubt! | Do my eyes deceive me? | Is there legit barbecue in Pittsburgh?! | Yinzburgh is truly an oddity in Oakland. | Yinzburgh, that's where. | Best Pittsburgh Bbq! | Priced reasonable as well.
| Will definitely be back! | Would come back to try more. | Can't say enough. | We will be back!
| Great new restaurant. | Needless not ever going back! | It probably took almost half an hour for 4 drinks to arrive , 3 of which were the same.
| I understand saving money but nobody would want the butt of the bread, consider your guests. | Only 13 points. | wouldn't go back to this location because of her. | You must drive back to get it corrected. | Not cool. | I'm done.
| Famous Daves has always been one of my main go to spots across the USA! | Difficult to go wrong here ... | Thanks for the 2 meat salute!!! | What I had at Famous Dave's earlier this afternoon was NOT BBQ. | Yeah, that's what I came for ... the bread. | Ultimate Burger, ,, enough said! | Went to Dave's last night for dinner. | I was totally taken by surprise. | I usually don't write negative reviews but I'm very concerned for young children due to the choking hazard this presents. | Check your sandwiches before you sink your teeth into them.
| The line is quick, the people are friendly and the drinks are tasty. | Very impressed Mr. Peets. | Considering this is in a busy airport, I was impressed. | Spotted in due to flight delay. | I figured I could get some work done. | It was pretty good. | I noticed the prices were a lil bit more expensive. | Much better than the Starsucks at the high C gates. | Try gingerbread latte yum. | I guess you can charge whatever you want when the airport doesn't have any other options in concourse C
| Immediately regretted it. | I did forget to mention that the other who posted pictures of the bathroom are correct. | Hardware barely works, the smell was beyond offensive, probably because nothing flushes correctly. | Nothing special here. | Not that there are many options around job. | com arena to choose from, sadly this is probably the best. | I'm surprised they're open. | I wouldn't come back here, ever again. | Went to McFadden's and could not get a decent Long Island or Manhattan. | General manager bought a round when my wife told him our story.
| Best Philly Ever!!! | Thank You Sam!!! | Next day I notice the charge has had a $2 tip added to it that I did not authorize. | ( I left a cash tip in the beer money jar ) I called Corporate and got nowhere because this is a franchise store. | I will not be coming back to the location ever again. | Looks like I will be going to firehouse for now on! | one New Year's resolution is to write more Yelp reviews, so here goes ... | In Vegas for NYE & gave this place a shot per other Yelp reviews. | Well, here it is. | We ordered the Bobbie and the Capastrami shared it. | No taste at all in either. | For a company that supposedly cooks overnight you would think the turkey ingredients would look like turkey but apparently they shred it into little tiny bits. | Will not return # 1 in Vegas for a reason. | Mine is definitely the Bobby. | Don't bother calling in an order. | If they tell you a time it will be off by at least thirty minutes. | quite flavorful , even the next day it tasted just as good. | Grab a Capistrami you can't go wrong, until next time Cappie's, be well.
| Woohoo.
| I left feeling physically ill. No way would I have ever tried this place if I didn't have a gift card to use. | I should have been paid to eat this garbage. | , no it's not, stupid people still exist. | There are a million places just like this. | We are stuffed and you will be too. | Best advice, pace yourself but crush the bread. | I most likely will not return here. | The new online ordering app worked seamlessly. | The waiter came out as soon as I pulled up. | No complaints.
| I dropped off 3 pieces and they got it done for me and ready for pick up the next morning right in time for my flight. | I will definitely be coming here again and dropping my things off when I m in town again. | I'll be back again. | I would definitely return to get alterations done on other items of clothing. | Seriously extraordinary! | Well they could and they did ... and it was something so simple that I am so shock that the people at David's Bridal couldn't event do it. | MUST come here for everything. | They know what they're doing!!! | They called me saying it was ready 3 days early. | Will be coming back here for sure!
| Then recently started getting mani - pedis. | I won't say they make it painless but they make it as pleasant as waxing can be! | Boooo hiss. | Nailsense had Pretty Woman on their large flat screen while we ate, drank, and were buffed and polished to perfection. | And the cost? | A mani / pedi here is $35. | Yep, you read that right. | 35 BUCKS! | DEFINITELY will be back! | So if you need a fill don't bother. | And to make matters worse they cut my cuticle too short and it hurts.
| Maybe I came on a bad night. | We hardly drank! | But we could if we had wanted to! | That said, I somehow don't hate it. | Went here during the lunch hours, maybe only 2 other tables had customers, no hostess greater us so we kind of sat our selves. | Needless to say, not impressed. | Although some of the waitresses could use some touch ups.
