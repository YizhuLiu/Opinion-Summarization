We release the data and codes used in our paper.
# Data
We uploaded the core codes in File "data":  
```
"yelp" contains synthetic semi-structured training pairs and generated summaries of Yelp.	  
"amazon" contains synthetic semi-structured training pairs and generated summaries of Amazon.
"rt" contains synthetic semi-structured training pairs and generated summaries of RottenTomatoes.
```

# Codes
We uploaded the core codes of synthetic data creation and proposed models in File "code". The details are described in `code/README.md`.
Both basic model and advanced model are implemented based on [Fairseq](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq) framework provided.
